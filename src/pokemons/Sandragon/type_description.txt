Dragon / Ground
 Sandragon is a dual Dragon and Ground-type Pokémon that embodies the ferocity and resilience of desert dragons. It starts its evolutionary journey as Sandrake, eventually becoming the mighty Sandragon. Known for burrowing and creating massive sandstorms to confuse its opponents, Sandragon uses its rugged scales for both defense and offense in battle.

Imagine the deep, rumbling growl of an earth-shaking tremor combined with the fierce hiss of a large lizard. This call should evoke Sandragon's commanding presence and its dominion over the sandy terrains it inhabits.
