Normal / Dark
 Ursashade is a dual Normal and Dark-type Pokémon that thrives in the dense, shadowy parts of forests. It evolves from Cubshroud and can further evolve into a formidable creature known only as Spectrabear. Ursashade uses the darkness of its habitat to its advantage, blending into shadows to avoid detection and surprise its prey.
