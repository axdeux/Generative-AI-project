Ghost
 Ghoulis is a Ghost-type Pokémon that thrives in the urban shadows of towering city buildings. It is known for its ability to blend seamlessly into the darkness, making it almost invisible to the naked eye. Ghoulis does not evolve but can increase its power by absorbing the ambient fears and whispers of the city's inhabitants.
