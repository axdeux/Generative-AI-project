Ghost
 Ghoulis is a Ghost-type Pokémon that thrives in the shadows of urban structures. It has the unique ability to blend seamlessly into any shadow, making it nearly invisible to both humans and other Pokémon. Ghoulis evolves from Shadelet and can evolve into Specterror, gaining more eerie abilities and becoming more formidable in battles, especially at night.
