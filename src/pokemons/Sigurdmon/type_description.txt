Dragon / Steel
 Sigurdmon is a dual-type Dragon/Steel Pokémon inspired by the legendary Norse warriors. It evolves from Drakkarmon and is known for its indomitable spirit and battle prowess. Sigurdmon wields a sword-like tail that can cut through the toughest armor and uses its dragon breath to forge steel, enhancing its own armor during combat.
