Ice / Fairy
 Glacifox is a dual-type Ice/Fairy Pokémon resembling a mystical arctic fox. It starts its evolutionary journey as Froxie and evolves into Glacifox when exposed to a Moon Stone under icy conditions. Known for its enchanting beauty and frosty fur, it can manipulate ice crystals to create illusions and protect its territory from intruders.

Imagine the soft whispers of falling snow combined with a high-pitched, melodic yip. This call should convey both the ethereal beauty and the sharp alertness of Glacifox.
